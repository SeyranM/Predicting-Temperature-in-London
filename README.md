# London Temperature Prediction

## About the Project

London Temperature Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the mean temperature in London, England.
The project uses historical weather data and incorporates various machine learning models such as Linear Regression,
Decision Tree, and Random Forest. A key aspect of this project is the use of MLflow for logging model performance
metrics, ensuring a systematic approach to model evaluation.

## Datasets

The project uses a comprehensive weather dataset specific to London, `london_weather.csv`, which includes various
meteorological parameters. The main target variable for prediction is the mean temperature (`mean_temp`).

## Technical Requirements

To run this project, Python 3 is essential. It also requires familiarity with data handling libraries (Pandas, NumPy),
machine learning libraries (scikit-learn), and MLflow for experiment logging. Basic knowledge of Jupyter Notebook or any
Python IDE is recommended.

## Installation

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- MLflow
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualizations)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

## Usage

To engage with this project:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have the london_weather.csv data file in your project directory.
- Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks provided in the repository to train models and log experiments with
  MLflow.
- Explore the visualizations generated for data analysis and model evaluation.

## Output

The project includes several scripts that preprocess data, train machine learning models, and log experiments using
MLflow. The outputs are:

- A series of trained models with logged performance metrics.
- Visualizations for data analysis and model evaluation.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome, especially those that enhance the model's accuracy, extend the dataset, or
improve the visualizations. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your changes.
